# Language Toggle Feature Requirements

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for implementing a comprehensive language toggle feature that allows users to switch between English and Hindi across the entire GauSakhi web application. The feature aims to make the application accessible to Hindi-speaking Gau-sewa workers while maintaining the existing English interface for broader accessibility.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Hindi-speaking Gau-sewa worker, I want to switch the entire application interface to Hindi, so that I can understand and use all features in my native language.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I visit the application THEN I SHALL see a language toggle button in the top-right corner of the header
2. WHEN I click the language toggle THEN the system SHALL immediately switch all visible text to the selected language
3. WHEN I switch to Hindi THEN all text including headers, buttons, descriptions, and navigation SHALL display in Hindi
4. WHEN I switch back to English THEN all text SHALL revert to English immediately
5. WHEN I reload the page THEN the system SHALL remember my language preference and display content in the previously selected language

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the language toggle to be visually clear and accessible, so that I can easily identify and use the language switching functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view the header THEN I SHALL see a toggle button with clear language indicators (üá¨üáß English / üáÆüá≥ ‡§π‡§ø‡§®‡•ç‡§¶‡•Ä)
2. WHEN I hover over the language toggle THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback (hover effects)

4. WHEN the language changes THEN the system SHALL apply a smooth transition animation
5. WHEN viewing on mobile devices THEN the language toggle SHALL remain accessible and properly sized

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a maintainable translation system, so that I can easily add, update, and manage translations across the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing translations THEN the system SHALL use a centralized translation management approach
2. WHEN adding new text THEN the system SHALL support easy addition of both English and Hindi translations
3. WHEN updating translations THEN the system SHALL allow bulk updates without code changes
4. WHEN missing translations occur THEN the system SHALL fallback to English gracefully
5. WHEN loading translations THEN the system SHALL handle loading states appropriately

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want all application content to be properly translated, so that I have a complete experience in my chosen language.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I switch languages THEN ALL static text including headers, navigation, buttons, and labels SHALL be translated
2. WHEN I switch languages THEN ALL feature descriptions and explanatory text SHALL be translated
3. WHEN I switch languages THEN ALL form labels, placeholders, and validation messages SHALL be translated
4. WHEN I switch languages THEN ALL testimonials and quotes SHALL be translated appropriately
5. WHEN I switch languages THEN ALL error messages and notifications SHALL be translated

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the language preference to persist across sessions, so that I don't have to reselect my language every time I visit the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I select a language THEN the system SHALL store my preference in browser localStorage
2. WHEN I return to the application THEN the system SHALL automatically load my previously selected language
3. WHEN I clear browser data THEN the system SHALL default to English
4. WHEN I use the application on different devices THEN each device SHALL maintain its own language preference
5. WHEN the stored language preference is invalid THEN the system SHALL fallback to English

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the language switching to be performant and responsive, so that the interface remains smooth and usable during language changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I switch languages THEN the change SHALL occur within 200ms
2. WHEN switching languages THEN the system SHALL not cause layout shifts or visual glitches
3. WHEN loading the application THEN the initial language setup SHALL not block the UI rendering
4. WHEN switching languages THEN the system SHALL maintain scroll position and user context
5. WHEN switching languages multiple times rapidly THEN the system SHALL handle all requests gracefully

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a Hindi-speaking user, I want authentic and culturally appropriate Hindi translations, so that the application feels natural and respectful to use.

#### Acceptance Criteria
